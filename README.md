# Tietoevry Open Source Learning Community

The Open Source Learning Community is a Tietoevry initiative, where we discuss all things Open Source!

So it's only natural that we would have a Github page then as well, right? üòÅ

[Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com)

We will post [minutes from our meetings](minutes.md) here, with links to any and all projects and topics we discuss. Please feel free to suggest topics, post links and anything else as an issue in this repo, and we'll get it on the agenda in an upcoming meeting!

## What is Tietoevry Open Source Learning Community
The Learning Community exists within Tietoevry to learn about Open Source - what it is, where it is, how its made and how we can contribute or make our own. 

So we host weekly Open Source Friday meetings on **Thursdays at 14:00 GMT+1**. We don't really have a fixed agenda, we just shot the breeze and talk about whatever comes up.
